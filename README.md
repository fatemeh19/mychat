# createGroupStep2
i use createGroupStep2 for add member to group because they use same functionality and same style but there is some difrence between them : in create group we add userId to memberIds array when load createGroupStep2 file but for add members we don't need do that & in create group we can select multiple conatact but in add member to group we add just one member to group at one try so i add one if that check if memberIds array length is over than one member and we select another member the prev member remove from array
